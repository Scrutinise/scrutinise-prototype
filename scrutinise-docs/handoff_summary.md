## CURRENT STATE

**Active branch:** Main
**Last sprint:** V5 — Hansard alternative + blocked sources + email state (3 Jun 2026)
**Latest commits:** `0d4fd84` (V4) — V5 code changes not yet committed

### What just happened (3 Jun 2026 V5 — Hansard alternative + blocked sources)

1. **TWFY client built** (`theyworkforyou.ts`): TheyWorkForYou API confirmed accessible from Railway (status 200, needs API key only). Source client + worker route + queue seeder all built. **ACTION NEEDED:** Register for TWFY API key at theyworkforyou.com/api/key, add `TWFY_API_KEY` to Railway env, then run `seed-twfy-queue.ts` (~4,700 monthly rows for Commons+Lords+Westminster Hall).

2. **FCA, ECHR, EUR-Lex blocked in manifest**: All APIs confirmed non-functional from Railway environment. Marked `blocked: true` — will show ⛔ blocked in email instead of ⚠️ failing.

3. **⚠️ failing state added to email**: Sources with queue rows but 0 corpus_sections now show `⚠️ failing` — visible signal that something is broken rather than appearing at 0%.

4. **Scheduler duplicate**: Not a code bug — two Railway deployments running simultaneously. Fix: manually redeploy `ingest-scheduler` in Railway dashboard to kill old instance.

5. **Data access request drafts**: `docs/data-access-requests/bailii-request.md` and `parliament-hansard-request.md` ready to send.

6. **corpus-census.md §8**: 19 sources with "client needed" added, with URLs for future build sprints.

### What just happened (3 Jun 2026 V4 — caselaw diagnosis + silent failure fixes)

1. **Caselaw `getTotalJudgments()` fixed** — TNA feed reports 7,489 pages but pages 1,500+ are empty. Binary-search now finds true last non-empty page (~1,499). We've ingested all ~74,950 available TNA caselaw judgments. `estSections` updated to 75,000.

2. **Silent failures now surfaced** — `processHansard`, `processFca`, `processEchr` now mark 'failed' (not 'done') when 0 items are yielded. Root causes confirmed:
   - FCA: `handbook.fca.org.uk` is a JS SPA — HTML scraping never works. Needs Playwright.
   - ECHR: `/app/query/results` returns 404 — API endpoint changed Jun 2026. Needs new endpoint.
   - Hansard: `api.parliament.uk/v1/hansard` returns 403 from Railway IPs. Written Answers/Statements use a different API that works fine.

3. **Reseed running:** UKPGA pre-1963 (6,897 rows) inserted; UKSI 2010-2026 completed; SSI/WSI enumeration rate-limited at 30s/request — still running.

4. **Queue state:** 5,307 primary-acts-pre-2000 pending rows, workers actively processing. Grand total corpus_sections: 587,128.

### What just happened (3 Jun 2026 Sprint 2 — queue gap seeding)

1. **Queue reset (Part 2):** 6,185 rows reset to pending for corpora with 0 corpus_sections (Hansard, FCA, ECHR, Treaties). Root cause: `api.parliament.uk/v1/hansard` returns 403 from Railway IPs — workers looped over 0 debates and marked rows done. FCA/ECHR similar pattern. Workers will retry on next claim cycle; Hansard API access needs Railway investigation.

2. **Queue reseed (Part 1):** `reseed-si-gaps.ts` run: (A) UKSI 2010–2026 enumeration from TNA (adds ~5k–8k new rows for 2015–2026 gap); (B) UKPGA pre-1963: 6,897 new rows inserted from Neon items with 0 sections; (C) SSI+WSI added to regional corpus. Workers now have 13,082+ pending rows — queue is no longer empty.

3. **Worker efficiency email (Part 3):** `queryWorkerThroughput` extended with sourceKey, efficiency %, and ⚡low/🔴critical flags. Each source has theoretical max adjusted by number of workers sharing the token bucket.

4. **Discovery fix (Part 4):** `TNA_CORPUS_META.regional` now includes ssi+wsi. `discoverTnaLegislation` detects under-seeded corpora dynamically (threshold 400 rows/yr) and triggers full historical scan when needed.

### What just happened (3 Jun 2026 late evening — corpus census sprint)

1. **Census scripts created** (`scripts/ingest/census/`): neon-counts.ts, railway-counts.ts, tna-counts.ts, source-counts.ts. Reusable — re-run quarterly.

2. **Census report written** (`docs/corpus-census.md`): Full findings with Neon vs. new pipeline comparison, gap analysis, source API counts.

3. **CORPUS_MANIFEST estSections updated** (`progress-reporter.ts`): Revised 8 estimates based on confirmed data. Most significant: SI-2010+ 300k→120k, Written Statements 50k→17,487. Total corpus estimate revised from ~7M to ~5.3M sections.

4. **Key action items identified:**
   - **SI-2010plus 2015–2026 reseed:** ~5k–8k missing SIs (50k–80k sections). High priority.
   - **Hansard/ECHR/FCA R2 backfill:** CCh to write backfill sprint brief.

### What just happened (3 Jun 2026 evening sprint)

1. **RangeError fix (Part 1):** `progressBar()` in `progress-reporter.ts` now clamps `pct` to `[0,100]` and `filled` to `[0,barWidth]`. Email sends were crashing every hour since compiled > estSections for some corpora.

2. **Worker throughput in email (Part 2):** Added `queryWorkerThroughput()` and a new "WORKER THROUGHPUT" section in `sendProgressEmail()`. Shows per-corpus sections/hr rate with mini bar, ⚠️ stalled / ℹ️ idle flags, total rate, stalled list. Uses 3-snapshot pivot to distinguish stalled vs idle.

3. **Diagnostics (Part 3):** Queue is exhausted (0 pending, 120 claimed, 61,829 done). Self-discovery is working — just trickle-rate new items now. Snapshot doubling bug (×2 SUM at 11:54 BST) is a one-time Railway restart overlap, not a systematic code bug.

4. **Sprint workflow (Part 4):** Created `docs/SPRINT.md` as the canonical home for CCh sprint briefs. Added sprint brief protocol to `CLAUDE.md` §12.

5. **Part 5 (read-only):** Confirmed Hansard/ECHR/FCA/Treaties have the R2 backfill gap. See CHANGE_LOG for exact counts and key patterns.

### Pending commit

All changes above need to be committed via `commit-all.sh`. **Do not run git mid-sprint** — produce `commit-all.sh` at end.

Files changed:
- `scripts/ingest/shared/progress-reporter.ts`
- `scrutinise-docs/CLAUDE.md`
- `scrutinise-docs/CHANGE_LOG.md`
- `scrutinise-docs/handoff_summary.md` (this file)
- `docs/SPRINT.md` (new)
- `scrutinise-docs/SPRINT.md` (CCh's original brief — can be cleared after commit)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Redeploy `ingest-scheduler` on Railway** — picks up the progressBar fix immediately
2. **Trigger one local scheduler run** to confirm email sends cleanly (no RangeError)
3. **Next sprint:** Hansard R2 backfill — CCh to write brief to `docs/SPRINT.md`:
   - List R2 keys under `hansard/` prefix
   - For each key, check corpus_sections existence
   - Fetch from R2, parse text, call upsertSection()
   - Run as one-off migration script
   - Investigate FCA/ECHR R2 key patterns before including them

## ARCHITECTURE SNAPSHOT (3 Jun 2026)

- **20 Railway workers** ingesting via `worker-queue.ts` — queue-claim model with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- **Scheduler** (`scheduler.ts`) — hourly loop, sends progress email, saves snapshots
- **Self-discovery** working — fills queue from live publication feeds when empty
- **Corpus coverage:** ~585,576 Railway sections + 914,274 Neon legacy = ~1.5M total
- **Hansard gap:** ~5,544 queue rows done, 0 corpus_sections — content in R2 only
- **ECHR/FCA gaps:** smaller but same pattern

## DEPLOYMENT

- Ingest workers: Railway (20 services)
- Scheduler: Railway (1 always-on service — `ecosystem.config.js`)
- DB: Railway PostgreSQL (`switchback.proxy.rlwy.net:16156`)
- R2: Cloudflare `scrutinise-legislation` bucket
- Web app: Vercel (scrutinise.org)
